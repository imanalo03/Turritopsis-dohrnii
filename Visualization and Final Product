**ape and ggtree to visualize tree in Rstudio**

A Newick string was generated using iqtree in Linux. I use these strings to visualize the phylogenetic tree using ape and ggtree packages in RStudio. 
The code includes the loading of the tree, assignment of label colors, and customization of the color scheme based on variants.

# Install and load the required packages
install.packages(c("ape", "ggtree"))
library(ape)
library(ggtree)

# Replace the tree_path with the Newick string generated by IQ-TREE
tree_path <- "(A_aurita:0.4186055484,((D_rerio:0.1864611808,(Gallus_gallus:0.1868684918,Homo_sapiens:0.2289689785)93:0.0774329442)73:0.0644680962,T_rubra:0.3428370769)100:0.1879758715,(H_vulgaris:0.1886053212,T_dohrnii:0.1872080924)100:0.3286924558);"

# Load the tree from the Newick string
shh_tree <- read.tree(text = tree_path)

# Specify colors for each label
label_colors <- c("Turritopsis dohrnii" = "blue", "Turritopsis rubra" = "green", "Gallus_gallus" = "red", "Homo_sapiens" = "purple", "Aurelia aurita" = "orange", "Hydra vulgaris" = "brown", "Danio rerio" = "pink")

# Assign colors to tip labels
shh_tree$tip.label <- label_colors[shh_tree$tip.label]

# Customize color scheme based on variants
ggtree(shh_tree) +
  geom_tiplab(align = TRUE, linesize = 1.5, offset = 0.0005, hjust = 0) +
  scale_color_identity() +
  theme_tree2()

**Additional Visualization with iTOL**
For enhanced phylogenetic tree visualization, I utilized iTOL platform. 
This step was taken to create a more elaborate and aesthetically pleasing representation of the tree using the same values obtained from IQ-TREE.
