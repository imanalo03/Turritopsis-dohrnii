I utilized IQ-TREE for constructing phylogenetic trees, analyzing 16s rRNA sequences. 

#My code for iqtree

iqtree -s output_MT.iv -m GTR -bb 1000 -pre Tdohrnii_tree

The parameters used in this command are:

#(-s):** This specifies my input sequence file. My file that contains all my 16s rRNA is 'output_MT.iv'

#(-m):** This specifies the nucleotide substitution model. I choose the General Time Reversible (GTR) model, allowing for variable rates of substitution.

#(-bb):** This specifies the bootstrapping value of 1000 replicates to assess the robustness of the tree.

#(-pre):** Here it assigns a prefix for my output files, with "Tdohrnii_tree" used as the prefix in my case.
