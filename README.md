# JellyGene Project: Exploring the Genetic Wonders of the Immortal Jellyfish - Using mitochondrion gene to find one which species are related to T.dohrnii and how these gene differ from other species
**Overview**

Welcome to the JellGene Project repository! The focus of this project is to investigate _Turritopsis dohrnii_, a unique type of jellyfish. This jellyfish is truly amazing since it has a unique ability that no other animal possesses: the ability to reverse its life cycle and prevent aging and death. For the most part, animals follow a linear path from birth through adulthood, old age, and death. Not the immortal jellyfish, though! It has the ability to revert to its youthful state rather than age when faced with difficult or stressful situations. This special ability is like pressing a restart button for its cells, keeping the jellyfish from getting old. 

This research explores the reasons why immortal jellyfish stay young, avoid aging, and escape death from old age. By examining their genes and comparing them with _Turritopsis rubra_, a regular jellyfish, I aim to identify the specific genes responsible for this extraordinary trait. The hope is that understanding these immortal genes will shed more light on the aging process and help find ways to keep cells healthy and rejuvenated.

**Obtain Genomic or Transcriptomic Data:**

-Search public databases like NCBI for available datasets of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ and _Turritopsis rubra_.

**Comparative Genomics:**

-Use BLAST to compare genes across _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, and potentially other species.

**Sequence Alignment:**

-Align orthologous gene sequences using MAFFT.

**Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**

-Construct a phylogenetic tree using iqtree.

**Visualization:**
- Find out how T.dohrnni mitochondrion varies from the other species. Using the output from MAFFT and visualizing using MSA?.
