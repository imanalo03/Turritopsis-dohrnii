# JellyGene Project: Exploring Mitochondrial Diversity in the Immortal Jellyfish

**Overview**

Welcome to the JellyGene Project repository! This project aims to unravel the mysteries of the immortal jellyfish, _Turritopsis dohrnii_, by exploring the diversity in its mitochondria and comparing it with _Turritopsis rubra_ and other selected species. The focus is on understanding how the mitochondria of these species differ and how they are related evolutionarily.

**Objectives**

1. **Obtain Genomic or Transcriptomic Data:**
   - Search public databases like NCBI for available datasets of _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, _Aurelia aurita_, _Hydra vulgaris_, _Homo sapiens_, _Danio rerio,_ and _Gallus gallus_

2. **Sequence Alignment of 16s rRNA:**
   - Align orthologous mitochondrial gene sequences using MAFFT.

3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**
   - Construct a phylogenetic tree using iqtree to visualize the evolutionary relationships among _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, _Aurelia aurita_, _Hydra vulgaris_, _Homo sapiens_, _Danio rerio,_ and _Gallus gallus_ based on their 16s rRNA sequences and bootstrap the tree for statistical support.

4. **Visualization of Mitochondrial Variation:**
   - Visualizing the variation in _Turritopsis dohrnii_'s 16s rRNA compared to other species using iTOL.

5. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Analyze the sequence variations on the 16s rRNA of _Turritopis dohrnii_ and the other species.

**Future Applications**

As we delve into the mitochondrial diversity of the immortal jellyfish, the findings of this study pave the way for potential future applications. Imagine unlocking the secrets encoded in the other genes of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ that contribute to its immortality. This knowledge could have profound implications for understanding the aging process in humans and developing strategies to maintain cell health and rejuvenation.
