# JellyGene Project: Exploring the Genetic Wonders of the Immortal Jellyfish
Overview

Welcome to the JellyGene Project repository! This project delves into the genomic mysteries surrounding the captivating phenomenon of the immortal jellyfish, _Turritopsis dohrnii_. This extraordinary species possesses a unique abilityâ€”it can revert back to its polyp stage, effectively escaping the processes of aging and death. The ability to undergo this transformation sets _Turritopsis dohrnii_ apart as the only known organism capable of biological immortality.

The Immortal Jellyfish Phenomenon

_Turritopsis dohrnii_, commonly known as the immortal jellyfish, defies the conventional life cycle. Unlike most organisms, which undergo a linear progression from birth to maturity, old age, and eventual death, this jellyfish has the remarkable ability to reverse its life cycle. When faced with unfavorable conditions or stress, it can transform from its mature medusa stage back into a juvenile polyp, starting the life cycle anew.
This biological process, known as transdifferentiation, allows the immortal jellyfish to reset its cellular clock and essentially achieve a form of immortality. By reverting to its polyp stage, it can escape the aging process and potentially live indefinitely under the right environmental conditions.
