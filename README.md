# JellyGene Project: Exploring the Genetic Wonders of the Immortal Jellyfish
**Overview**

Welcome to the JellGene Project repository! The focus of this project is to investigate _Turritopsis dohrnii_, a unique type of jellyfish. This jellyfish is truly amazing since it has a unique ability that no other animal possesses: the ability to reverse its life cycle and prevent aging and death. For the most part, animals follow a linear path from birth through adulthood, old age, and death. Not the immortal jellyfish, though! It has the ability to revert to its youthful state rather than age when faced with difficult or stressful situations. This special ability is like pressing a restart button for its cells, keeping the jellyfish from getting old. 

This research explores the reasons why immortal jellyfish stay young, avoid aging, and escape death from old age. By examining their genes and comparing them with _Turritopsis rubra_, a regular jellyfish, I aim to identify the specific genes responsible for this extraordinary trait. The hope is that understanding these immortal genes will shed more light on the aging process and help find ways to keep cells healthy and rejuvenated.

**Obtain Genomic or Transcriptomic Data:**

-Search public databases like NCBI for available datasets of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ and _Turritopsis rubra_.

-Use SRAtoolkit to download Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data efficiently.

-For other animals, use databases like Ensembl or NCBI. 

**Data Preprocessing:**

-Perform quality control on your raw sequencing data using tools like FastQC.

-Trim and filter reads with Trimmomatic to remove low-quality bases or adapter sequences.

**Genome Assembly or Transcriptome Assembly:**

-Assemble the genomic or transcriptomic data of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ and _Turritopsis rubra_.

-Use genome assemblers like SPAdes and de novo assembly methods.

**Gene Annotation:**

-Annotate genes in the assembled genomes using Maker.

**Comparative Genomics:**

-Use BLAST to compare genes across _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, and potentially other species.

**Sequence Alignment:**
