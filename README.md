# JellyGene Project: Exploring Mitochondrial Diversity in the Immortal Jellyfish

**Overview**

Welcome to the JellyGene Project repository! This project aims to unravel the mysteries of the immortal jellyfish, _Turritopsis dohrnii_, by exploring the diversity in its mitochondria and comparing it with _Turritopsis rubra_ and other selected species. The focus is on understanding how the mitochondria of these species differ and how they are related evolutionarily.

**Objectives**

1. **Obtain Genomic or Transcriptomic Data:**
   - Search public databases like NCBI for available datasets of _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, and other chosen species.

2. **Comparative Genomics of Mitochondria:**
   - Utilize BLAST to compare mitochondrial genes across _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, and selected species.

3. **Sequence Alignment of Mitochondrial Genes:**
   - Align orthologous mitochondrial gene sequences using MAFFT.

4. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**
   - Construct a phylogenetic tree using iqtree to visualize the evolutionary relationships among _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, and other species based on their mitochondrial genes.

5. **Visualization of Mitochondrial Variation:**
   - Explore the variation in _Turritopsis dohrnii_'s mitochondria compared to other species. Visualize the aligned sequences to gain insights into the unique features of the immortal jellyfish's mitochondria.

**Future Applications**

As we delve into the mitochondrial diversity of the immortal jellyfish, the findings of this study pave the way for potential future applications. Imagine unlocking the secrets encoded in the other genes of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ that contribute to its immortality. This knowledge could have profound implications for understanding the aging process in humans and developing strategies to maintain cell health and rejuvenation.
