# JellyGene Project: Exploring Mitochondrial Diversity in the Immortal Jellyfish

**Overview**

Welcome to the JellyGene Project repository! This project aims to unravel the mysteries of the immortal jellyfish, _Turritopsis dohrnii_, by exploring the diversity in its mitochondria and comparing it with _Turritopsis rubra_ and other selected species. The focus is on understanding how the mitochondria of these species differ and how they are related evolutionarily.

**Objectives**

1. **Obtain Genomic or Transcriptomic Data:**
   - Search public databases like NCBI for available datasets of _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, _Aurelia aurita_, _Hydra vulgaris_, _Homo sapiens_, _Danio rerio,_ and _Gallus gallus_

2. **Sequence Alignment of 16s rRNA:**
   - Align orthologous mitochondrial gene sequences using MAFFT.

3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**
   - Construct a phylogenetic tree using iqtree to visualize the evolutionary relationships among _Turritopsis dohrnii_, _Turritopsis rubra_, _Aurelia aurita_, _Hydra vulgaris_, _Homo sapiens_, _Danio rerio,_ and _Gallus gallus_ based on their 16s rRNA sequences and bootstrap the tree for statistical support.

4. **Visualization of Mitochondrial Variation:**
   - Visualizing the variation in _Turritopsis dohrnii_'s 16s rRNA compared to other species using iTOL.

5. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Analyze the evolutionary relationships on the 16s rRNA of _Turritopis dohrnii_ and the other species.


**Evolutionary Relationships Summary of _T. dohrnii_ with 7 Other Species**

The phylogenetic tree unravels how species are connected through their 16S rRNA sequences. _Turritopsis dohrnii _ stands out, showcasing its unique traits in the evolutionary tree. The branch reaching _Aurelia aurita_ spans a significant 0.4186 units, indicating a notable distance in mitochondrial genes.

In another group with _Gallus gallus_, _Homo sapiens, and T. rubra_, there are varied distances â€” 0.1869 units for _G. gallus_, 0.2290 units for H. sapiens, forming a well-supported clade (bootstrap support of 93). This group also includes T. rubra with a bootstrap support of 73. _T. rubra_, specifically, shows strong isolation and evolution, with a branch of 0.3428 units and robust bootstrap support of 100. Additionally, exploring the genetic dynamics within _Hydra vulgaris _and _T. dohrnii_, the branch lengths reveal insights into their mitochondrial genes. The branch to _H. vulgari_s is 0.1886 units long, and the branch leading to _T. dohrnii_ is 0.1872 units long. The entire clade, with both species, is well-supported by a bootstrap value of 100, emphasizing confidence in their shared evolutionary history.

In conclusion, this phylogenetic tree visually narrates the diverse evolutionary paths of these species, emphasizing _T. dohrnii_'s unique position and shedding light on the genetic factors influencing its extraordinary life cycle of revival.
