# JellyGene Project: Exploring the Genetic Wonders of the Immortal Jellyfish
**Overview**

Welcome to the JellyGene Project repository! This project delves into the genomic mysteries surrounding the captivating phenomenon of the immortal jellyfish, _Turritopsis dohrnii_. This extraordinary species possesses a unique abilityâ€”it can revert back to its polyp stage, effectively escaping the processes of aging and death. The ability to undergo this transformation sets _Turritopsis dohrnii_ apart as the only known organism capable of biological immortality.

**The Immortal Jellyfish Phenomenon**

_Turritopsis dohrnii_, commonly known as the immortal jellyfish, defies the conventional life cycle. The majority of animals follow a straight path from birth to adulthood, old age, and death; nevertheless, this jellyfish possesses the amazing capacity to reverse its life cycle. It can return to its juvenile polyp stage from its mature medusa stage in response to adverse conditions or stress, thus initiating a new life cycle.
The immortal jellyfish can effectively achieve a type of immortality through a biological process called transdifferentiation, which resets its cellular clock. It is able to avoid aging and possibly live forever under the correct environmental conditions by going back to its polyp stage.

This research explores the reasons why immortal jellyfish stay young, avoid aging, and escape death from old age. By examining their genes and comparing them with T. rubra, a regular jellyfish, I aim to identify the specific genes responsible for this extraordinary trait. The hope is that understanding these immortal genes will shed more light on the aging process and help find ways to keep cells healthy and rejuvenated.
