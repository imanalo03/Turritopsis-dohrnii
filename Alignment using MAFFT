I aligned the genetic sequences of T. dohrnii, T. rubra, Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, A. aurita, H. vulgaris, and D. rerio using MAFFT, a versatile multiple sequence alignment tool.
By using the '--auto' option, the command enables MAFFT to choose the best alignment, taking into account the length of the input sequence. 
Next, the sequences that have been aligned are stored in the 'output_MT.ivÂ file'. This process makes sure that genetic data from several species may be compared accurately and effectively.
