I've compiled mitochondrial genome sequences from diverse species, obtained from NCBI. 
Using the 'nano' command, I organized the data into individual text files, choosing simple and clear names like species1.txt. 
Each file follows the FASTA format, starting with the '>' symbol, followed by the filename and species-specific mitochondrial nucleotide sequences.

#My code to create a text file for a species using nano
nano species_mitochondrion_sequence.fasta

#Content within species_mitochondrion_sequence.fasta
>species_mitochondrion_sequence.fasta
ATCGATCGATCG...

Then, I put them all together into one file so it's easy to find and use everything. 
#In the directory containing my text files
cat *sequence.fasta > combined_MT.iv
Now, all the sequences are stored together.
