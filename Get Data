 collected nucleotide sequences for different mitochondrial species from NCBI. For organization and ease of use, I created individual text files for each species, naming them as species1.txt, species2.txt, etc. Each file follows a format where each entry starts with the > symbol followed by the species identifier and the corresponding filename.

Code Snippet:
bash
Copy code
# Create individual text files for each species
echo ">Species1" > species1.txt
cat species1.fasta >> species1.txt

echo ">Species2" > species2.txt
cat species2.fasta >> species2.txt

# Repeat for other species...

# Concatenate all individual species files into a single file
cat *.txt > combined_species.txt
In the code snippet, replace species1.fasta, species2.fasta, etc., with the actual filenames of your nucleotide sequences in FASTA format. Adjust the species identifiers accordingly.

This script creates individual text files for each species and then combines them into a single file named combined_species.txt. The combined file can be used for further analysis or processing.
