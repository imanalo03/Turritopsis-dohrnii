I've compiled mitochondrial genome sequences from diverse species, obtained from NCBI. Using the 'nano' command, I organized the data into individual text files, adopting clear naming conventions like species1.txt. 
Each file follows the FASTA format, starting with the '>' symbol, followed by the filename and species-specific mitochondrial nucleotide sequences.

#Example code to create a text file for a species using nano
nano species1.txt

#Content within species1.txt
>Species1
ATCGATCGATCG...

Then, I put them all together into one file so it's easy to find and use everything. 
# Assuming you are in the directory containing your text files
cat species*.txt > combined_sequences.fasta
Now, all the sequences are stored together.
