I gathered nucleotide sequences from NCBI for many mitochondrial species. 
I made separate text files with the names species1.txt, species2.txt, and so on for each species in order to make them easier to use and organize. 
Every file has a format where each item begins with the symbol > and is followed by the filename and species nucleotide fasta sequences.
