I've compiled mitochondrial genome sequences from diverse species, obtained from NCBI. Using the 'nano' command, I organized the data into individual text files, adopting clear naming conventions like species1.txt. 
Each file follows the FASTA format, starting with the '>' symbol, followed by the filename and species-specific mitochondrial nucleotide sequences.
